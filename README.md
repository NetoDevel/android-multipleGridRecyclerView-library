### How to use it

Use it with your own data model to show like a LinearLayout or GridLayout. Encapsulate your data model into Cell model to span by row/columns simultaneously. 
Even you can mix different data models.

####first init recyclerView

Create MultipleGridRecyclerView layout
```xml
  <com.ruialonso.multiplegridrecyclerview.MultipleGridRecyclerView
    android:id="@+id/multiple_grid_recycler_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
  />
```

####set adapters viewholders width its data model
```java
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setAdapterDataViewHolder(CellImageWidget.class, CellImageViewHolder.class);
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setAdapterDataViewHolder(ImageWidget.class, ImageViewHolder.class);
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setAdapterDataViewHolder(TextWidget.class, TextViewHolder.class);
```

####customize grid columns or cell aspect ratio dynamically
```java
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setGridColumns(columns);
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setCellAspectRatio(ratio);
```

####customize empty and loading views 
```xml
  <attr format="reference" name="empty_view_layout"/>
  <attr format="reference" name="loading_view_layout"/>
```
or 
```java
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setEmptyViewLayout(View)
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setEmptyViewLayoutByIdRes(@IdRes int)
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setEmptyViewLayoutByLayoutRes(@LayoutRes int)
  
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setLoadingViewLayout(View)
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setLoadingViewLayoutByIdRes(@IdRes int)
  multipleGridRecyclerView.setLoadingViewLayoutByLayoutRes(@LayoutRes int)
````

### TODO
 - bug when last row has elements with different heights, layoutmanager just take last element on row, not highest element
 - bug adding first element, don't renderize it until second element added

### Based on
* [EasyRecyclerAdapter] to perform Adapters and ViewHolder factory
* [Plaid] for SpannedGridLayoutManager
